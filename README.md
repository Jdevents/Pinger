# ➤ Pinger

Pinger was created during the Townsville 2020 Super Car's event.
It was created for one purpose that this is to ping ip's, I had created it to ping some switches we had around the track which were used to get sound to the different zone's.


Pinger does have the following features:
    Name what each ip is
    All ip's and names are saved to a .json
    Can ping up to 12 ip's at once
    Visual wornings when a ping is to high
    A notify icon that has a menue built in to see all pings and ping times
